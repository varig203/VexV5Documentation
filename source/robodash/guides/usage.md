# Using Robodash

Robodash provides multiple functionalities for different use cases:

- If you would like to learn more about Robodash's suite of built-in widgets,
  such as the autonomous selector, see the [widgets guide](./usage/widgets.md).

- If you want to integrate your own LVGL GUIs with Robodash, see the
  [views guide](./usage/views.md).

- If you're a template developer looking to depend on Robodash, check out the
  [template guide](./usage/template.md) as well
